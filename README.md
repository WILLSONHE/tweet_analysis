With the emergence of Internet companies such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, more and more data accessible online is comprised of text. Textual data and the computational means of processing it and extracting information is also increasingly more important in areas such as business, humanities, social sciences, etc. In this assignment, you will deal with textual analysis. Twitter has become very popular, with many people “tweeting” aspects of their daily lives. This “flow of tweets” has recently become a way to study or guess how people feel about various aspects of the world or their own life. For example, analysis of tweets has been used to try to determine how certain geographical regions may be voting – this is done by analyzing the content, the words, and phrases, in tweets. Similarly, analysis of keywords or phrases in tweets can be used to determine how popular or unpopular a movie might be. This is often referred to as sentiment analysis.
